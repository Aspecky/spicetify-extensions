# Where now playing

Click the currently playing song's cover to go to where it's playing from, this used to be the default behavior until [spotify decided otherwise](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Podcasts-Partners-etc/Clicking-on-album-art-no-longer-jumps-to-the-current-playlist/m-p/5888765/highlight/true#M107988) and moved it to the "Now playing view".
