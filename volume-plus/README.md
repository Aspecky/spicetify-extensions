Overrides Spotify's default volume mouse wheel control and adds a tooltip to see and modify your volume.

### By default:
* Mouse wheel and left/right arrows increment volume by 5%
* Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> while using the mouse wheel or up/down arrows increment the volume by 10%
* Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while using the mouse wheel will increment the volume by 1%

You may customize the volume increments by clicking your profile picture top right and selecting `Volume+`
